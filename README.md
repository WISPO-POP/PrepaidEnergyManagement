* datasets - used to store data for experiments.
* simple-experiments - to run experiments with simulation durations as a multiple of 1 day. Data present in files _datasets/simple-experiment-data-1.csv_, _datasets/simple-experiment-data-2.csv_, and _datasets/simple-experiment-data-3.csv_ can be used. 
* monthly-experiments - to run experiments with simulation durations as a multiple of 1 month. Residential electricity usage data can be obtained from [Pecan Street Dataport](https://www.pecanstreet.org/dataport/licenses/). 
* In each folder, run the file _main.jl_, supporting functions are present in _functions.jl_.
